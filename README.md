## Context Templates for Detailer MCP

This repository contains the official collection of context templates for the [Detailer MCP](https://detailer.ginylil.com), an AI-powered co-pilot for developers. These templates provide reusable prompts, configurations, and workflows to accelerate development tasks.

## What are Context Templates?

Context templates are structured files (YAML or Markdown) that define specific instructions and context for the Detailer MCP. They are designed to help with a variety of tasks, from enforcing coding standards to automating common workflows like generating pull request descriptions.

## How to Use These Templates

The templates in this repository are accessed through the Detailer MCP using a set of powerful tools:

### `list_templates`
Discover all available templates. You can see their names, descriptions, and types. This helps you find the right template for your task.

### `get_template`
Download a template's raw content directly into your workspace. This is useful when you want to view or customize a template to fit your specific needs.

### `do_template`
Execute a template directly and receive immediate, context-aware output. Instead of just getting the template file, `do_template` processes it and provides you with the generated result, such as a feature plan or a list of best practices.

## Using Context Templates with MCP Public Token

You can access context templates directly via MCP (Model Context Protocol) using the public token. This allows you to use templates across different AI development platforms without needing to clone this repository.

## Template Types

This repository is organized into three main categories of templates:

-   **`rules`**: Define coding standards, best practices, and style guides for various languages and frameworks (e.g., React, Python, TypeScript).
-   **`shortcuts`**: Provide quick actions and generators for common development tasks, like creating feature plans or generating PR descriptions.
-   **`workflows`**: Contain multi-step processes and guides for more complex development scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The templates are organized into directories based on their type:

```
templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ rules/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cursor/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ react.yml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ python.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ shortcuts/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ task_planning_and_feature_development.yml
â””â”€â”€ workflows/
