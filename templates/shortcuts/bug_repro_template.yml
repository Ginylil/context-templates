  # Bug Report: Login form validation not working

  - **App Version**: 2.1.3
  - **Device**: MacBook Pro M2
  - **Screen Resolution**: 1920x1080

  ## 🔄 Steps to Reproduce
  1. Navigate to `/login` page
  2. Enter an invalid email address (e.g., "notanemail")
  3. Enter any password
  4. Click the "Login" button
  5. Observe the behavior

  ## ✅ Expected Behavior
  - Form should show validation error for invalid email format
  - Login button should remain disabled until valid data is entered
  - User should not be able to submit the form

  ## ❌ Actual Behavior
  - No validation error is shown
  - Form submits with invalid email
  - User sees generic "Login failed" message from server

  ## 📋 Additional Information
